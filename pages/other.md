The following sections outline additional content and functionality identified by NDSU, with notes as to how each element will be incorporated into the larger framework described in the [project overview](/). For the most part, our understanding is that all of this content will fit into one of the three key areas of the overall site. 

### 1. Non-ag Content (Gravity Switch) 

As noted by NDSU:

> The Non-ag Content part of the project focuses on the auditing, re-organizing, and migration of non-ag (community, family, food, health, horticulture, and money) NDSU Extension content.

This is the largely same content described above in the Extension section of the project overview. For the purposes of this project EC assumes all of the content will live in Extension section of the website, under the appropriate program or department.

**Questions**

* 
* Gravity Switch is developing a new content architecture for this that will presumably differ from the structure outlined in the project overview -- when will this work be complete? 
* We are assuming it will not introduce new content types or functionality beyond what is described above?
* Need clarity on 4-H -- we assume if it is included it will function the same as the rest?

### 2. Central services

Central services are external services provided by NDSU that will be used to pull in content throughout the new website. These include:

* **Directorie**
* **New**
* **Newsletter**

**Questions:**

* Aside from newsletters, how will we be accessing this data? 
* Is there a documented API for each, or a feed of some sort?
* What type of data will we get in response? (JSON, XML, ?) 
* Are we able to query the data? (e.g. query news by department, or topic -- query directory by department)
* NDSU notes the directory will need to be expanded to include AES/CAFSNR -- when will this work be completed?
* What documenation is available for accessing these services? 
* Does every department/group etc. have a newsletter? How many are there? 
* We need to determine best way to integrate these in a flexible way throughout as needed

### 3. Calendars/Event registrations

As noted by NDSU:

> This service is critical to the Engagement Strategy and will be developed by Electric Citizen within Drupal.

**Questions**

* We are assuming a single calendar using tags etc. that can be used throughout the site, correct?
* Tagged events will show up as links in other areas of the site as needed 
* Currently you use an external link for registrations -- can we assume that will continue to be the case? 
* We did not budget for or include in scope a full registration system

### 4. Research Extension Centers

As noted by NDSU:

> There are 7 Research Extension Centers (REC) across the state. Along with the Main Station and Agronomy Seed farm, each of them will need web content associated with their location, staff, and work.

Example: https://www.ag.ndsu.edu/research/research-extension-centers

These currently live under the hub of Extension, and we assume they will remain so. 

**Questions** 

* Possible Group candidate
* The Group module allows a small group of editors to self control their part of the website

### 5. NDSU Extension County Offices

As noted by NDSU:

> There are 53 County Extension Offices across the state. Each of them will need web content associated with their location, staff, and work.

As with research centers, this content will continue to live under the main Extension umbrella.

**Questions**

* Another group candidate

### 6. Multidisciplinary Issues & Research Projects

> Some topics and issues do not fit neatly within a particular topic or even a section of the site. In some cases (e.g. Farm/Ranch Succession Planning), the intended audience will dictate the section of the site the content belongs in (e.g. Farm/Ranch Succession Planning belongs on the Ag Hub). In cases of new issues or projects in which the content is not clearly organized into a topic or section, it can be created as Multidisciplinary Issues within Extension or Ag Hub, or Research Projects with AES.

**Questions**

* Are you intending a new content type for this, or simply normal "pages" that will get added where they best fit?
