## Design/templates

Because of the need to align as much as possible with the look and feel of NDSU‚Äôs overall web presence, the foundation of the design for this project will be the ‚ÄúNDSU 2018 template‚Äù available with the NDSU CMS (TYPO 3) and mirrored on the Drupal-based NDSU Admission webpages.
